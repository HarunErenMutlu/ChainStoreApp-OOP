Homework
In this homework you are expected to implement an “Chain Store App” in Java.
You should fulfill the concepts of:

Defining Classes
CSV file I/O
Arrays
2 - dimensional Arrays
Constructors, Getters & Setters

In the Chain Store Application, purchase and sale information of 4 stores are stored and queried.
You are expected to implement necessary classes to load data from given CSV files and create
desired queries. The given CSV files are listed below:

In “HW1_Items.csv”, the information is as follows:
Name,ID,Category

In “HW1_Transactions_Store1.csv”, the information is as follows:
ID,PurchasePriceFor1stMonth,SalePriceFor1stMonth,NumberOfSalesFor1stMonth,PurchasePriceFor2ndMonth,SalePriceFor2ndMonth,
NumberOfSalesFor2ndMonth,...
(Note: Transaction files contain purchase price, sale price and sale count of an item for 12 month)

Format of other CSV files for the remaining 3 stores are the same with the first one.
Note that the IDs in the Items file and Transactions files are referring the same item.


You are expected to implement classes for Item , Transaction , ItemTransaction , AnnualSale ,
StoreQuery , ChainStoreApp (the class with main method) and other helper classes (e.g. FileIO )
with the information given below:

Item:

ID
Name
Category

Transaction:

Purchase Price
Sale Price
Number of Sales

ItemTransaction:
Item
Transactions

✓ Note: Two-dimensional array that holds Transaction objects for each Store for each Month.

✓ Ex: For 3rd store - September, it is [2][8]


AnnualSale:

ItemTransaction→ [0, 32]

✓ Note: One-dimensional array that holds 33 ItemTransaction objects.

Implement necessary methods to respond the following queries in StoreQuery class:

1 - Most profitable item for the whole year

✓ Note: Most profitable item is the item that have a maximum profit. Profit of an item is
(Sale Price – Purchase Price) x Number of Sales

2 - Most profitable category for the whole year

✓ Note: Not all categories have the same amount of items

3 - Least profitable item for the whole year

4 - Least profitable category for the whole year

5 - Most profitable item for a single sale

6 - Best-selling item for the whole year

7 - Most profitable store for each month

Important Notes:

1. Do NOT request inputs in your app. Printing the results of the queries will be enough. You
should print names of the results instead of printing IDs or indices.

2. You are NOT allowed to use List / ArrayList interfaces in this homework. You can implement
helper methods to increase the capacity of arrays when it is needed.

3. You can use standard java.io packages to read files. Do NOT use other 3rd party libraries.

4. You should use relative paths (e.g. Files/sample.csv) instead of absolute paths (e.g.
C:\user\eclipse-workspace\MyProject\Files\sample.csv).

5. To support Turkish characters you may need to change your project’s text file encoding to
UTF8: Right click on your project (in package explorer) → Properties → Text file encoding →
Other → UTF8 → Apply.

6. You are expected to write clean, readable, and tester-friendly code. Please try to maximize
reusability and prevent from redundancy in your methods.
